        The Metronic Datatable component supports local or remote data binding. For remote data
        binding you can specify a remote data source that returns data in JSON/JSONP format. In this
        example the grid fetches its data from a remote JSON file. It also defines the schema model
        of the data source received from the remote data source. In addition to the visualization,
        the Datatable provides built-in support for operations over data such as sorting, filtering
        and paging performed in user browser(frontend).
